        <p>
          We find that if we want to incentivize people to publish data has to solve two problems.
          <br />
          <br />
          1, A seller should be rewarded by publishing data and the data become public goods. <br />
          <br />
          2, others can not re-sell the published data to a third party, because it's already a public goods. <br />
          <br />
          Darkforest Data market is proud to provide a Zero knowledge proof technology to create a data market to solve
          these two problems, and empower a seamless crowdfunding data market for Users <br />
