Darkforest data publishing market place

### Motivation
Sellers try and sell data all the time. After the data is sold, sellers have to trust that that the buyer will not give away or re-sell the data to a third party.It is easy to make copies of data so people will always be able to re-sell data. An alternative approach is to be paid to publish some data to everyone.Here we propose a way to publish data so that everyone is able to pay for it at once. Once a certain amount has been raised the data is published or the seller is unable to retrieve the funds.
